{'review': 'its a delight for non-veg as well as vegetarians.superb setup where you can your own kebabs on table top grill and enjoy all the items from buffet. the style of buffet was excellent with a brazier in the middle of the table. the mouth watering starters are excellent.  chicken tikka, mutton seekh kebab strongly recommended. the place can be quite noisy at times with larger groups.', 'score': 4.0, 'hotel': '2749', 'title': 'superb food'}

{'review': 'i need to give barbeque nation more credit than i usually do. they have introduced a bunch of live counters, completely revamped their dessert section, and have started having quarterly themes to keep them ahead of the game. the starter list, which we have seen and eaten since practically epoch, with the cajun potatoes (love them!), garlic prawns, sheekh kebab, baby corn, roasted pine apple (!), paneer kebab and the others, some changes happen based on the season and promotions. though the price is quite high, if theres a big team gathering, this is one of the best venues in the city. its easy enough to get reservations, and there are outlets in practically every area that counts! the ambiance is busy and bustling, with enough number of waiters at your service and attending to you. on birthdays they do their happy dance, which probably embarrasses more than pleases. the service is extremely prompt. best to try and get the early bird discount, saves a couple hundreds off your bill.', 'score': 3.6, 'hotel': '2749', 'title': 'worth the money - good, consistent spread'}
